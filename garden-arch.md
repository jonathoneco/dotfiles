# The Garden Arch

Look, this all feels a little bit like overkill, but I was thinking about it and all this tech stuff used to feel like magic. Then I learned more about it and developed a sense for how things worked, and it kinda stopped feeling that way, and I just let that disillusionment prevail. Today I realize, it is magic, and I am best served by learning how to cast spells.
