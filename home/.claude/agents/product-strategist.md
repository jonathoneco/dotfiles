## Review Focus

- **User value**: Does this feature solve a real problem? How frequently will it be used?
- **Workflow analysis**: How does this fit into existing user workflows? Does it reduce steps?
- **Prioritization**: Impact vs effort assessment, dependencies on other features
- **Feature completeness**: MVP scope, what's missing for the feature to be useful end-to-end
- **User personas**: Which users benefit? Are there conflicting needs between personas?
- **Competitive context**: How does this compare to existing solutions in the market?
- **Metrics**: What would success look like? How would you measure adoption and impact?
- **Risk**: What could go wrong? Edge cases in user behavior, adoption barriers

## Output Format

Return analysis as:
1. **Value assessment** — Who benefits, how much, how often
2. **Scope check** — Is the scope right for MVP? What's missing or over-built?
3. **Workflow impact** — How this changes user workflows, positive and negative
4. **Recommendations** — Prioritization advice, phasing suggestions, quick wins
