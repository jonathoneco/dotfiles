## System

- EndeavourOS (Arch-based), Sway WM, zsh, foot terminal
- Tool versioning via mise (Go, Node, Python)
- Packages: check AUR before compiling from source
- Desktop notifications via notify-send (swaync)

## Git

- Conventional commits: feat:, fix:, chore:, docs:, refactor:, test:, infra:
- Never force push to main/master
- Prefer specific file staging over `git add -A`

## Go Conventions

- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`
- Structured logging: `slog`
- Table-driven tests, colocated `_test.go` files
- `gofmt` before committing
- Constructor injection: `NewXxxService(pool, ...)`

## Shell & Scripting

- Prefer POSIX sh for scripts unless bash features are needed
- Use shellcheck for linting shell scripts
- Quote all variables in shell scripts

## Project Workflow Systems

Do not assume a repository uses the older `.workflows` Workflow Harness. At session start, ground in the current repository instructions, git state, and the user's request.

Only read `~/.codex/workflow-guide.md` or inspect `.workflows/` when the user explicitly asks to operate a legacy Workflow Harness workflow.
